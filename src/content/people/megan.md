Megan is a third year PhD student in Computer Science at MIT CSAIL, advised by Professors Paul Liang and Armando Solar-Lezama. Her research interests include

1. Enhancing the perception and reasoning of multimodal foundation models on abstract visual diagrams that are out-of-distribution from real-world images, such as charts, scientific figures, and visual math problems. 
2. Developing new techniques to align vision, language, code, and numerical modalities. 

She aims to develop AI systems that flexibly interface with humans in a multimodal manner, beyond text.
