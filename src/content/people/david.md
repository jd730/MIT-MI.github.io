I am a [Media Lab](https://media.mit.edu/) student at MIT under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Liang](https://pliang279.github.io/). My research interests lie in the field of multimodal learning and its applications to healthcare. I am currently working on developing AI systems that can assist clinicians in making better decisions.

Before joining MIT, I was a masters student at Stanford University majoring in Computer Science. I was a research assistant in Stanford SVL and Partnership in AI-Assisted Care (PAC) Lab supervised by [Dr. Li Fei-Fei](https://profiles.stanford.edu/fei-fei-li/) and [Dr. Ehsan Adeli](http://stanford.edu/~eadeli/).

Before joining Stanford, I graduated with the highest honor in Computer Science and Math from Emory University. I was in Emory Brain Network Lab under the supervision of[Dr. Carl Yang](http://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/), working on graph mining in the area of healthcare.
