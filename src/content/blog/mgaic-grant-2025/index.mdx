Paul Liang of the Multisensory Intelligence group, with  Wojciech Matusik (EECS), received funding for their proposal, "Multimodal Tactile Sensing for Robotics." This proposal is an extension of their [prior work](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/fits-like-a-flex-glove/overview/), presented at CHI in May—a tactile sensing glove that serves as a tool for recording human-centered touch interactions and training robotic policies that learn from them.
